# Assignment - Product Reviews

Product reviews are evaluations or opinions shared by consumers who have purchased and used a specific product or service. These reviews are typically written on online platforms such as e-commerce websites, social media, or review websites.

Product reviews provide insights into customers' experiences, satisfaction levels, and perceptions of a particular product or service. In the context of NLP (Natural Language Processing), product reviews are a valuable source of text data that can be analyzed to extract sentiments, opinions, and insights.
